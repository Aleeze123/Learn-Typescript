/*
Typescript enhance javascript by adding a type system. This means you can specify what type of data
(such as string , number, boolean or any complex object) can be stored in a variable . This specification
helps catch error during developement, making your code  more robust and maintainable  */

// Type inference in TypeScript allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable
//  based on the value assigned to it. This means you don't always have to explicitly declare the type.
